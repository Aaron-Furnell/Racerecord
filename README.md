This is a solution to the Pearson BTEC Level 3 Nationals Extended Diploma (Computing) that was done in College:

    You are asked to use your software design, development, testing and evaluation skills to produce a program that meets a client’s requirements.
    
    A local elite athletics academy has commissioned you as a Junior Software Developer to write a program.
    
    The program should allow the coach to record race times for the 100 metre elite athletes and display them in order from fastest to slowest.
    
    You need to create a program that:
    
        • enables the coach to choose if the race involves male or female athletes
        • allows the coach to enter finishing times for athletes in lane order
        • displays finishing times in order from fastest time to slowest time to two decimal 
        places
        • displays a message alerting the coach if a World, European or British record has been 
        achieved.
    
    You must design, implement and test your program. You must also justify and evaluate your decisions.
    
    When you are designing, and developing the solution ensure that:
    
        • standard programming conventions have been followed
        • it is efficient and robust
        • a suitable data structure is used
        • outputs are meaningful
        • it is easy to use
        • the program is tested using normal, abnormal and extreme data.
    
    Information
    
        You should use the information in Figure 1 when you are designing and developing your 
        program:
        
        Men’s Record Times Women’s Record Times
        World Record Time 9.58 World Record Time 10.49
        European Record Time 9.86 European Record Time 10.73
        British Record Time 9.87 British Record Time 10.99
        
        Minimum number of athletes in a race = 4
        Maximum number of athletes in a race = 8
        Figure 1
    
        Note: record times correct as of September 2017.
